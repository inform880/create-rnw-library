# Create React Web or/and Native library

CLI which allows creating libraries for web and React Native applications.

Code sharing is important, thus React Native and Web.

The Cli will create template project for your library with typescript, storybook, jest and linters out of the box.

This bootsraped library can be used both in React and React Native projects, ideally for libraries that need to share code between apps (eg ui-kit).
